## Hi! I'm Lukas.
I don't know how well you know me, but I am a software developer, designer, and beginning composer, as well as the owner of this website.
Here is a small timeline of where I started and how I got here.
I am 18 as of May 2nd 2025.

The website you are on has been built 100% by me line by line - from the backend, frontend framework, to the design and content. Zero copied code. Zero AI code. Zero 3rd party libraries were used (excluding fonts and icons).
Let's see how we got here.

My interest in tech started when I was about 7. I loved electronics, and was fascinated by user interfaces and aesthetics.
My first "software" project was when I turned my presentation assignment into a website and expanded it into a wikipedia clone called "LukasWiki".
I was also starting to discover Android application development (in Sketchware) and Scratch.

My first logo was actually created by my first Android application, which all it did was spin text really fast, and I took a screenshot of a random emoji sequence.
I then uploaded that image as my Google profile picture, and it became history.
My current logo keeps the same color scheme.
Crazy that at the time I was just a random kid playing Angry Birds Transformers with no clue that what I am about to do will have such an impact on my life.

In ~2018 at the age of 11, I got my first laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad X240, after my dad). About a year later I started writing my first "fullstack" web applications in JS and PHP, like an image hosting platform, a URL shortener/document sharing, and this is also when ExtraGon v1 was created.1
Since then I have been creating many projects nearly every day, made my first IDE at 15, and kept enhancing my skills over time.

There are simply too many projects to list, as I liked to just do everything, from games, websites, utilities, mobile apps, libraries, networking code, even full complex interfaces.
I've been fascinated by operating systems, so a lot of my first projects were mockups or simulations.

Rough timeline:
- ~2016-2018: Experimenting, electronics, Android apps, and basic HTML.
- ~2019: First "actual coding" projects. Also started experimenting around with vector graphics and proper UI/UX design.
- 2020 to today: Consistently creating projects with a goal.
- 2023: Switched fully to Linux, and no joke, that has been the best decision of my life. I have been infinitely more productive since then. At the time of writing, I haven't used Windows in over 2 years. Also started *attempting* to compose music.
- ~2024: Made my first production-grade software, and set higher code quality standards since then.

Some of my interests:
- Software development
- UI/UX design
- Networking software
- Game development
- Music composition and sound design
- Optimization and performance
- Science, chemistry, and physics
- Aesthetics (including Frutiger Aero, which has a special place in my heart <3)
- Open source software (Yes, I use Linux)
- Nokia phones (all eras from monochrome, S60, to Symbian Belle)
